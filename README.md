# Try out EUI locally

Uses a modern bundler, namely Rspack, so it feels fast.

## Setup (less than a minute)

Clone this repo ([degit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit) is quick):

```bash
npx degit acstll/rspack-eui-demo my-project
```

- `cd` into the folder e.g. `cd my-project`
- install deps with the package manager of your choice (yarn, pnpm, etc.) e.g. `pnpm install`
- run it e.g. `pnpm dev`
- open http://localhost:8080/
